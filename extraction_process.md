# Research Paper Processing Instructions\n\n## Current Process\n\nWhen downloading and reading research papers:\n- Download the PDF generally from arXiv with wget (focus on robotic manipulators, modularity, and morphology design unless specified otherwise).\n- Use Mathpix (https://mathpix.com/) to extract text and mathematical formulas from the PDF to paper.md, preserving equations in LaTeX format for better accuracy.\n- Use venv/bin/python3 play_extracted.py to convert paper.md to extracted_audio.wav (it takes a while, assume it works). Note: May need to adjust the script to handle markdown or LaTeX.\n\nWhen playing a research paper:\n- Change the name of extracted_audio.wav before playing.\n\nWhen playing anything:\n- Play it with VLC, just once, ignore errors, assume success.
